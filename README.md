# Portfolio

Link to deployed site: [https://jcdon.github.io/PortfolioJCC/](https://jcdon.github.io/PortfolioJCC/)

## Description


This site was created using bootstrap and html to create a site for displaying my personal portfolio. Three pages display my Main Info, Contact Info, and About Me Info. All links are active and working and lead to polished profiles and resume.


This main page contains all of the projects that I am displaying and provides links and images for anyone wishing to view my work.

This about page tells all about who I am and contains an image of myself at the Washington Youth Academy. At the bottom of the page are my contact info and links to my github, linkedIn, and resume.

This contact page is the source for anyone viewing my portfolio to leave their contact info for me to review and reach out to them when ever they submit a contact request.
